## 🧠 Agent Architecture

- Built with **LangChain** to handle user queries
- Uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pattern
- Document embeddings stored in **Pinecone vector DB**
- LLM responses generated via **OpenAI API** (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4)
- Future support for **voice queries**, **Autogen AI tours**, and **project explainers**

## 🌐 Deployment Guide (Free via Vercel)

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuralfolio.git
cd neuralfolio
npm install
```

### 2. Add Environment Vars
Create `.env.local`:
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
VITE_PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-key
VITE_PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your-env-id
VITE_PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=portfolio-index
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
- Push code to GitHub
- Import to Vercel (auto CI/CD setup)
- Add `.env.local` values via Vercel dashboard
